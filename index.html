<h3>Type of Peers Matters: A Study of Peer Effects of Friends, Studymates and Seatmates on Academic Performance (with Julian Tszkin Chan)</h3>
    <p>
      This paper studies the peer effects of friends, studymates, and seatmates on academic performance. 
      We obtain the information of social networks, personality traits, and cognitive ability measures from a unique data set based on a survey we conducted in three schools in Hong Kong. 
      We estimate a social interaction model which accounts for endogenous network formation and correlation between multiple networks. 
      Our results show that the cognitive ability of studymates and the conscientiousness of friends positively affect a studentâ€™s mathematics exam score, while the conscientiousness of studymates and the cognitive ability of friends do not produce such an effect. 
      We find that students with elder siblings are less affected by the cognitive ability of studymates, but the effect of conscientious friends is not related to that. 
      By contrast, we find no such effect from seatmates.
      These results are consistent with the idea that studymates influence each other through discussing and teaching where cognitive ability is valued. 
      On the other hand, friends influence each other by creating an atmosphere of studying, so being conscientious is more important.
      Our study hint at the way different types of peer work and which particular qualities are important for each peer type.

<h3>A Risk Redistribution Standard for Practical Cryptocurrency Payments'' (with Jeff Hu and Tina Lee) IEEE DAppCon 2019 Proceeding</h3>
	<p>Cryptocurrencies are developed as a decentralized and trustless payment system, in which participants should be able to conduct payments across borders with acceptable latency. However, the fluctuation of the exchange rate between crypto and fiat currencies has raised significant concerns and thwarted the prevalence of cryptocurrency payment adoption. Existing solutions require merchants to liquidate the received cryptocurrency on an exchange platform. To compensate for the exchange rate risk, merchants tend to charge a higher price in cryptocurrencies compare to in fiat currency, which dampens the incentive of customers to choose cryptocurrencies as the means of payment. This paper proposes an architecture bolstered by smart contracts to transfer the risk from the merchants to the cryptocurrency issuer. This narrows the gap between prices denominated in cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, and thus increases the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method. The Ethereum blockchain is chosen as the experimental environment in this work, yet the architecture can be migrated to other decentralized systems without additional efforts. This work devises a novel ERC standard to resolve the payment at a predetermined exchange rate that can be employed by any existing cryptocurrency. Immutable events on the blockchain will be generated upon the issuance and settlement of a payment, which are considered as the receipts for granting rights to the merchants to settle the payment at a regular basis. The architecture demonstrates a notable reduction on the exchange rate risk for the merchants, solving the primary problem of cryptocurrency payment adoptions nowadays.</p>

<h3>Revisiting Wet Bias: the Case of Typhoon Forecasting in Southeast Asia (with Yi Cheng)</h3>  
<p>This paper investigates the bias in typhoon forecasting caused by the strategic decisions of the weather observatories instead of technological limitations. We develop a model of strategic typhoon forecasting assuming that the observatory minimizes the expected cost of misreporting. The model predicts that the observatory's forecasting path would be biased towards the region where the observatory serves. We utilize the data of forecasted and realized typhoon paths from 2009 to 2017 from the Hong Kong Observatory and the Central Weather Bureau(Taiwan). We overcome the identification difficulty by focusing only on the situation where two relatively small regions with similar but independently operated observatories are affected by the same typhoon. The direction difference of the bias rules out the possibility that the bias is merely a technological limitation. The empirical results also show that the bias would be more substantial if the typhoon is stronger and when the path is more uncertain, which confirms the model's prediction. Our results are robust in similar data such as typhoons between Taiwan and Japan. Our study also shed light on media bias which shares the same economic principles, but the bias is not as objectively measured.</p>

<h3>Incentive Contracts, Adverse Selection, and Risk Transfer: Evidence from Procurement (with Meng Liu)</h3>
    <p>
    Multi-attribute auctions, designed to address multi-dimensional preference, make a good case study where incentive provisions interact with competition. By studying ``Cost+Time'' highway procurement that aims to incentivize timely project delivery, we show the lack of complementarity between incentive contracts and bidding mechanisms that can yield sub-optimal outcomes. Our theory demonstrates that bidders, facing high-powered incentives and production uncertainty, optimally skew their time bids while transferring production risk to buying agencies. This gaming behavior leads to adverse selection and efficiency loss, in that a less-efficient bidder can outbid the efficient bidder due to the misalignment between bidder types and the auction rule that determines winners. We estimate our model using data from the California Department of Transportation and find that 18% of auctions are allocated to inefficient bidders. Counterfactual analyses suggest that procurement schemes with lower incentives can yield less mis-allocation with lower production costs and less buyer budget pressure.

<h3> Measuring Consumer Surplus in the On-Demand Economy: the Case of Ride Sharing (with Meng Liu)</h3>
    <p>
    Uber and Lyft, two pioneer ride-sharing platforms that serve as alternatives to traditional taxi cabs, have seen dramatic increase in adoptions from both consumers and driver-partners across the globe over the last few years. To understand their roles and impacts on the whole economy, we tackle the problem of consumer welfare of these ride sharing platforms by estimating a structural demand model for rides. In this model, consumers choose between Uber, Lyft, Taxi cabs, and the ``outside option'' based on price, convenience, brand effects, and unobserved characteristics. Our estimation and identification leverage on the unusually rich data set that combines taxi, Uber, and Lyft trip records from New York City, and Uber/Lyft surge pricing as well as wait time at granular location-time levels. Being among the first few, our work contributes to the understanding of the On-Demand Economy by providing evidence of consumer welfare increase due to vast satisfied instantaneous demand at minimal transaction costs.

<h3>Optimal Price of In-game Items and Game Diffculty</h3>
	<p>This paper investigate the roles and interactions between the pricing of in-game items and game difficulty. Since the firms(game platform) obtain their revenue from premium players, but the utility of the premium players depends on the time spent by the free players, there is an optimal proportion of free players in the game. The game platform achieves the optimal by controling the pricing of in-game items and game difficulty. Analytical model shows sensible comparative statics to the proportion free players. Numberical results shows insights about the pricing strategies, the choices between subscription-based pricing and per-item pricing.

<h3>Managing the release of consumable in-app purchases in competitive games (with Christopher Ryan and Michelle Wu)</h3>
    <p>
    A common practice for freemium games is to launch with a simple and intuitive design and release premium features over time in the form of in-app purchases (IAPs) to monetize players. We propose an optimal control model that yields insights into the optimality and economic justification of such an approach. Through analytically characterizing the game life cycle and optimal release pattern of IAP for certain structured instances, we characterize when games optimally launch with an initial period free of IAPs in order to maximize the growth of its player-base and later exploit this player-base for generating revenue by releasing IAPs. This strategy balances the tradeoff between the effects of IAP release on acquiring and retaining players with the revenue-generating potential of selling IAPs. Our model also admits comparative statics results on how exogenous factors, such as the social nature of the game, influence the optimal time of initial IAP release. In a numerical study, we show that a game can be permanently free if it generates revenues outside of player purchases, say through advertising revenue. We also consider the possibility of an operating loss during the free period due to per-player operating costs. We show the length of the loss period (while the game is totally free) and the magnitude of loss depends on exogenous factors, including the strength of word-of-mouth.

<h3>The Value of Your Data: Privacy and Personal DataExchange Networks (with Clara Jean and Babur De Los Santos) </h3>

	<p>Personal users' information is highly valuable to online platforms. While there is evidence of trade of users' data  among suppliers, little is known about the conditions of these data exchanges. We ran a field experiment to uncover the determinants of this trade between suppliers and investigate  the effectiveness of the new European regulation on data protection (GDPR) aiming to give more control back to users about their privacy. </p>
